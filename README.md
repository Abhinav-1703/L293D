# Motor Control with L293D and Arduino

This project demonstrates interfacing an L293D motor driver with an Arduino to control a motor. The motor speed is linked to two LEDs, where one LED brightens as the motor speed increases and the other LED dims.

## Features
- Control a DC motor using an Arduino and L293D motor driver.
- Adjust motor speed using PWM.
- Brighten one LED as motor speed increases.
- Dim another LED as motor speed decreases.
